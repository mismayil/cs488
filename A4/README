Compile:
    make [OPT=[01]] [AABB=[01]]
    You can specify whether you want to turn on acceleration(OPT) or not and whether you want to render only axis aligned bounded boxes(AABB) instead of meshes.
    By default, OPT=1 and AABB=0
Run:
    ./A4 lua-file
    Note: I have changed all paths relative to Assets directory, so please run them inside A4, not Assets!

Lab computer: gl35

Extra feature:
    All features have been implemented and as an extra feature I implemented supersampling over 9 rays (3x3 grid).

Acceleration:
    Acceleration is enabled by default. If you want to switch it off, just compile with OPT=0.
    Note that AABB will not work if OPT is turned off.
    I could not include timin
