Compile:
    make [OPT=[01]] [AABB=[01]]
    You can specify whether you want to turn on acceleration(OPT) and whether you want to render only axis aligned bounded boxes(AABB) instead of meshes.
    By default, OPT=1 and AABB=0
Run:
    ./A5 lua-file
    Note: I have changed all paths relative to Assets directory, so please run them inside A5, not Assets and specify path as Assets/lua-file.

Lab computer: gl32

Extra feature:
    All objectives have been implemented and as an extra objective multithreading has been added to speed up the process.
