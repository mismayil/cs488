	<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
In this assignment you will create a hierarchical, articulated 3D
humanoid model, which we'll call a "puppet".  By "articulated" we
mean that the puppet has a number of hinge-like joints whose angles can
be controlled interactively, for example
bending an arm at the elbow.  By "hierarchical" we mean that the
puppet is encoded in a hierarchical data structure that represents
parent/child relationships between body parts; for example, when
the elbow bends, the hand and fingers stay attached to the lower
arm and rotate with it.  The whole puppet will be constructed from
transformed instances of simple geometric primitives, and will be lit 
interactively, using a combination of lights and materials that 
make the 3D structure clear and comprehensible.  You must also support
interactive undo/redo of joint manipulations.
</p>

<p>
The on-screen puppet is the visualization of a many-layered
tree data structure.  The "skeleton" of the tree represents the 
functional, hierarchical relationships between the body parts in the 
puppet. Thus, the root node is tied to the torso of the puppet, and
gives the model-to-world transform of the puppet as a whole.  The 
root has two children as part of this skeleton: a subtree anchored at
the shoulders, containing further subtrees for the arms and head, and another
anchored at the hips, containing subtrees for the legs.  The skeleton
might be visualized loosely as follows:
</p>
<center>
<img src="./a3_files/a3-tree.png" width="600" height="209">
</center>
<p>
The actual tree you construct will have many more internal
nodes.  For example, you'll likely want to include intermediate
transformation nodes that represent the geometric relationships
between body parts and their parents (for example, that the lower
arm has its centre of rotation at the elbow, and is positioned at
the end of the upper arm).  In addition, you'll naturally want to
associate geometry with these abstract body parts!  Most of these
nodes are likely to have subtrees coming off of them with rigid
arrangements of transformed primitives, giving actual form to the
puppet.  (We provide you with a small class hierarchy to implement
the required tree nodes, consisting of a <code>SceneNode</code> base
class with its children <code>JointNode</code> and <code>GeometryNode</code>; 
those classes can be used in lots of ways
inconsistent with the description here, but we recommend you stick
to our suggested approach.)
</p>

<p>
Your final puppet might look something like this:
</p>

<center>
<img src="./a3_files/a3-puppets.png" width="500" height="537">
</center>

<p>
The figure on the left shows the full overlapping outlines of scaled
spheres; the one on the right has hidden surfaces removed.  You are
welcome—indeed encouraged—to improve upon this basic structure
to create your own interesting puppet. Feel free to add more geometry
and more skeletal structure (and hence, more points of articulation).
You can add fancier joint types, new geometric primitives, custom
materials and lighting, and just about anything else you like.  Have a 
look at the <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs488/gallery-A3.html">online CS 488 gallery</a> for past examples of wild puppets.
Just make sure your puppet fulfills a few minimal requirements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>The puppet should support at least <b>fifteen</b> degrees of freedom
	(DOFs), that is, joint angles that can be manipulated interactively.
	For the humanoid puppet above, there are 
	three DOFs each arm and each leg, and three more for the
	head and neck, as follows:
	<ul>
	<li>The arm DOFs should correspond to the rotation of the upper
		arm at the shoulder, the lower arm at the elbow, and the
		hand at the wrist.  These rotations should all take place in
		the same plane (as in the arm motion one might make when lifting
		weights).
	</li><li>The leg DOFs should correspond to the rotation of the upper
		leg at the hip, the lower leg at the knee, and the foot at the ankle.
		</li>
	<li>The head and neck DOFs should correspond to the rotation of the
		base of the neck at the shoulders, the head at the top of the
		neck, and the side-to-side rotation of the head around its
		axis.</li>
	</ul>
	You don't need to use exactly these DOFs, but you should have at
	least as many.</li>
<li>All angles should have reasonable legal ranges, enforced by the
	user interface.  For example, it should not be possible to hyperextend
	the knees or elbows, to rotate limbs through each other, or to
	rotate hands or feet to less than 90 degrees from arms or legs.</li>
<li>The head should not simply be an undecorated sphere.  Make sure to
	include at least some piece of geometry that allows us to see that
	head rotation is working correctly.</li>
<li>You should use multiple distinct materials (see the 
	<code>set_material()</code> method below) and the scene should be lit
	using at least one light source.  The simplest light source to implement
	is a point light located at the eye.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Modelling</h3>

<p>
The structure of the puppet is not contained in the source code of
the application, but in an external file that is interpreted when the
program starts.  Rather than creating our own file format for describing
puppets, we introduce <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> as a
scripting language.  We're already using Lua (as part of 
<a href="https://premake.github.io/">premake4</a>) to create Makefiles,
and the language has been used extensively in games.
Note the potential benefit here: because the puppet
is defined procedurally, you can take advantage of standard programming
abstractions to streamline your design (for example, think about writing a
function to generate an arm, and then calling it twice).  We will continue
to use Lua to describe scenes in Assignment 4.
</p>

<p>
To begin constructing a puppet, we need a root for our modelling
hierarchy. We can get one by asking for a transform node and assigning
the result to a Lua variable. The name passed to the function is
useful for debugging purposes.
</p>

<pre>myroot = gr.node('root')
</pre>

<p>
Geometry nodes hold and can render mesh data.  In order to create a 
geometry node, you pass in the ID of the mesh you want to use, and a node
name as above. Then you need to connect it to a parent node:
</p>

<pre>torso = gr.mesh('sphere', 'my_torso')
myroot:add_child(torso)
</pre>

<p>
Note the use of a colon above.  In Lua, ":" is used to call a member 
functions on an instance and "." is reserved to call regular functions or
static class functions. We
might then set the material properties of and transform the torso:
</p>

<pre>torso:set_material(gr.material(...))
torso:translate(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
</pre>

<p>
Finally, we simply return the root node of the puppet:
</p>

<pre>return myroot
</pre>

<p>
Conceptually, the transformation at a node is applied to both its
geometry and its children, and matrices deeper in the tree are
premultiplied by matrices higher in the tree.
</p>

<!-- This assumes that column vectors are used to represent points. -->

<p>
As mentioned earlier, the tree shown above shows only the functional
relationships between puppet components.  <em>Your</em> tree will need to
have additional joint nodes, containing transformations and joint
rotation ranges. You will transform these joint nodes to manipulate
the puppet. You may also need extra nodes to prevent child nodes
from being affected by transformations meant to modify only the
geometry of a parent node. Watch out, in particular, for scales.
You generally will not want these in the middle of a chain of
transformations.
</p>

<p>
We define the following set of modelling functions for you, as the
tools we expect you'll need to complete the assignment:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>gr.node(name)</code>: Return a node with the given name, 
	with the identity as its transformation matrix and no children.</li>
<li><code>gr.mesh(id,name)</code>: Return a <code>GeometryNode</code>
	tied to the mesh with the given ID, and with the given name.
	The meshes are stored in the <code>Assets/</code> directory, and
	are loaded and associated with IDs at program initialization
	time—see the use of <code>meshConsolidator</code> in
	<code>A3::init()</code>. You can use that mechanism to add
	additional mesh types to the program, but keep in mind that the
	goal of the assignment is to assemble an articulated model from
	a large number of relatively simple parts, not necessarily to
	spend all your time creating really elaborate meshes.
	</li>
<li><code>gr.joint(name, {xmin, xinit, xmax}, {ymin, yinit, ymax})</code>:
	Create a joint node with minimum rotation angles <code>xmin</code> and
	<code>ymin</code>, maximum rotation angles <code>xmax</code> and
	<code>ymax</code> and initial rotation angles <code>xinit</code> and 
	<code>yinit</code> about the <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> axes.</li>
<li><code>pnode:add_child(cnode)</code>: Add <code>cnode</code> as a child
	of <code>pnode</code>.</li>
<li><code>gr.material({dr, dg, db}, {sr, sg, sb}, p)</code>: Return a
	material with diffuse reflection coefficients <code>dr</code>, 
	<code>dg</code>, <code>db</code>, specular reflection coefficients 
	<code>sr</code>, <code>sg</code>, <code>sb</code>, and Phong
	coefficient <code>p</code>.</li>
<li><code>node:set_material(mat)</code>: Assign the given material to the
	given node. Node materials can be changed at any time.</li>
<li><code>node:rotate(axis, angle)</code>: Rotate node about a local coordinate
	axis (<code>'x'</code>, <code>'y'</code> or <code>'z'</code>) by 
	<code>angle</code> (in degrees).</li>
<li><code>node:translate(dx, dy, dz)</code>: Translate the given node by 
	(<code>dx</code>, <code>dy</code>, <code>dz</code>).</li>
<li><code>node:scale(sx, sy, sz)</code>: Scale node by
	(<code>sx</code>, <code>sy</code>, <code>sz</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
We have created the "glue code" for you (i.e., the code that defines 
these Lua functions and makes them available in your puppet script),
and bound these to functions and methods within the scene graph.
You may also add Lua bindings to the
assignment if you want to support other new features, but make sure
the functions described above continue to work as written.
</p>
<p>
As an intermediate milestone, you can test your implementation with 
the provided file <code>a3mark.lua</code>, which should render to produce
the image <code>a3mark.png</code>. We will
use this script to test some of the functionality of your assignment
ourselves.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<b>Caution:</b> In the past, students have found the creation of this model
to be the most time consuming part of this assignment. You will
probably want to design it on paper before writing the Lua code for
the model.
</div>

	<h3>The interface</h3>

	<p>
	As always, your application should include a GUI panel implemented
	in ImGui, supporting at least the following features.  Most features
	have associated keyboard shortcuts indicated in parentheses.  You
	may, but are not required to include these shortcuts in the actual
	names of the items as they appear in the GUI.
	</p>

	<ul>
	<li>There should be a menu bar across the top of the GUI panel containing 
		<b>Application</b>, 
		<b>Edit</b> and <b>Options</b> menus, each described below.</li>

	<li>The <b>Application</b> menu should contain the following five
		items:
		<ul>
		<li><b>Reset Position</b> (keyboard shortcut <b>I</b>):
			Reset the origin of the puppet to its initial position.</li>
		<li><b>Reset Orientation</b> (<b>O</b>): Reset the puppet to its
			initial orientation.</li>
		<li><b>Reset Joints</b> (<b>N</b>): Reset all joint angles, and 
			clear the undo/redo stack.</li>
		<li><b>Reset All</b> (<b>A</b>): Reset the position, orientation,
			and joint angles of the puppet, and clear the undo/redo stack.</li>
		<li><b>Quit</b> (<b>Q</b>): Terminate the program.
		</li></ul>
	</li>

	<li><p>The <b>Edit</b> menu should contain items labeled <b>Undo</b> 
		(<b>U</b>) and <b>Redo</b> (<b>R</b>), which maintain an undo/redo
		stack of transformations.
All joint transformations should be saved to the stack. The paradigm
is that when you release a mouse button when in joint manipulation
mode (see below), the current joint angles are stored on the undo/redo stack.
Initially, the stack contains just the initial joint angles.  We may think
of saving a new state as pushing a new layer of state onto the stack.
At all times, you should maintain a current
position in the stack. Selecting undo from the edit menu will restore
the joint angles to the entry below the current position
(and update the position marker to that entry).  Selecting
redo will update the joint angles to the entry above the current
position (and update the position marker).
</p>
<p>
If several joint transformations are undone, and a new
joint transformation is initiated, all undo/redo entries above the
current one should be cleared. If <b>Reset All</b> or <b>Reset Joints</b> are
selected from the File Menu, the undo/redo stack should be cleared
to its initial state.
You should provide reasonable feedback to indicate that an attempt
to undo or redo past the end of the stack has been attempted (and
not allow the action).
</p>
<p>
A standard object-oriented approach to maintaining an undo/redo stack is
to use the Command pattern (which you may have seen in CS 246).  It may help
to consult Robert Nystrom's 
<a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/command.html">online tutorial</a>
about the Command pattern in game programming.
</p>
</li>

	<li>The <b>Options</b> menu should include the following options.
		Each one should be a checkbox menu item, capable of being
		enabled or disabled independently of the others.

		<ul>
		<li><b>Circle</b> (<b>C</b>): If checked, draw a circle to
			indicate the region of the screen being used as the boundary
			for trackball rotation. The circle is drawn for you 
			(unconditionally) in the skeleton code.</li>
		<li><b>Z-buffer</b> (<b>Z</b>): If checked, use depth buffering when
			drawing the puppet.</li>
		<li><b>Backface culling</b> (<b>B</b>): draws the puppet with 
			backfacing polygons removed.</li>
		<li><b>Frontface culling</b> (<b>F</b>): draws the puppet with
			frontfacing polygons removed. 
		</li></ul>

		By default, Z-buffering should be enabled and the rest of these
		options should be disabled.</li>

	<li>Beneath the menu bar there should be two radio buttons
		used to select the interaction mode for the main application
		window.  The modes are as follows:
		<ul>
		<li><b>Position/Orientation</b> (<b>P</b>): Translate and rotate the 
			entire puppet.  This should be the initial mode when the
			application is launched.  In this mode, the different mouse
			buttons have the following effects.
			<ul>
			<li>Dragging with the left mouse button held down changes the
				<var>x</var> and <var>y</var> translations of the puppet
				in world coordinates.  (For example, modifying the puppet's
				<var>x</var> translation should always move it left and
				right on the screen, not relative to its current local
				coordinates.)</li>
			<li>Dragging with the middle mouse button held down changes
				the <var>z</var> translation of the puppet; moving
				the mouse up on the screen should move the puppet away
				from the viewer, and moving it down should bring the
				puppet closer.</li>
			<li>Dragging with the right mouse button held down should
				initiate a "virtual trackball" that controls the 
				orientation of the puppet around its own origin.  Imagine
				a virtual sphere centered in the application window whose 
				diameter is 50% of the
				width or height of the framebuffer, whichever is
				smaller (as demonstrated by the circle drawn in the
				skeleton code).  That sphere will act as a virtual 
				input device for comunicating 3D rotations to the application.
				<!-- CSK: Demo program for virtual trackball? -->
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			It may help to introduce extra transformation nodes near the
			root of the puppet to store its translation and rotation.
			</p>
			</li>

	<li><b>Joints</b> (<b>J</b>): Control joint angles.  In joint mode
		the three mouse buttons act as follows.

		<ul>
		<li><p>Clicking with the left mouse button selects or deselects 
			individual joints.  A joint is selected by clicking on part
			of the geometry immediately beneath it (for example, clicking
			on the lower arm should select the elbow joint).  Clicking
			on geometry not immediately under a moveable joint should
			have no effect.  Clicking on a selected joint should deselect
			it.  The selection operation is a toggle:
			<em>it must be possible to have multiple joints selected at
			the same time</em>.
			</p>
			<p>
			Picking is implemented by switching into a special rendering
			mode in which all lighting and materials are discarded, and 
			objects are rendered in false colours that encode each object's
			identity.  (Note that every <code>SceneNode</code> instance
			already has a unique serial number stored in <code>m_nodeId</code>,
			which you can map to the false colour of the primitives.)
			You can then read the colour of the framebuffer at
			the mouse location to know which object was selected.  You'll
			have to create a new fragment shader or modify the existing one
			to enable picking.  We may provide some additional sample code
			to demonstrate this process later.
			</p>
			<p>
			Selecting an item should cause a visible change in the rendering
			of that item (by changing the material).
			</p></li>

		<li>Dragging with the middle mouse button should change the angles
			of all selected joints.  In particular, use the relative 
			<var>y</var> motion of the mouse to increase or decrease joint
			angles, clamping to their defined ranges as needed.</li>

		<li>Dragging with the right mouse button should be used purely
			for the operation of rotating the head to the left or right.
			This manipulation is applied only if the head is selected.
			Note that it should be possible to use the middle and right
			mouse buttons in combination to turn the head in conjunction
			with other joint motions.
		</li></ul>
		</li>

	</ul>
</li></ul>

<p>
Note that in the assignment code, the <b>M</b> key will show and hide the
GUI panel entirely.  It can be useful to hide the GUI panel for saving
glamour shots of your puppet.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
If you are unable to get picking working correctly (by using the left
mouse button in <b>Joints</b> mode, you'll nevertheless need some way
to select and deselect joints.  In that case, we recommend that you create
a <b>Pick</b> menu that includes checkboxes for all the selectable joints
in your hierarchy.  You won't get the mark for Objective 3, but you can
still get marks for the various joint manipulation modes.
</div>

<!-- <h3>OpenGL</h3>

<p>
You must write code to create a single sphere primitive using sines and
cosines, with transformations and materials assignable in shaders,
stored in suitable VBOs/VAOs.  This code should run exactly <em>once</em>
at initialization time, and all subsequent sphere drawing should use the
same VBO.  (Obviously if you add other types of primitives to the assignment, 
you can create other buffers for them.)  Use just enough points that
the sphere is reasonably smooth on screen, without using so many that
the application lags.  Note that you should make sure the sphere vertices
have normal vectors associated with them, and that the normal vectors
have unit length.
</p>
<p>
You should light the sphere with at least one light source (which can be
hardcoded in your shaders if you like).  The simplest light source to use
is a point light located at the eye.
</p> -->

<h3>Donated code</h3>

<p>
Please download the file <code><a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs488/Fall2015/cs488-a3.zip">cs488-a3.zip</a></code>
and unzip it from within your top-level <code>cs488</code> folder.  It's especially
important for this assignment that you unzip from inside the <code>cs488</code>
folder.
We've added a standardized installation of Lua to <code>shared/</code>, and
we need those files to get installed in the right locations.  Your zip program
should prompt you to replace a few files, including the top-level 
<code>premake4.lua</code>,
which you should accept.  It shouldn't overwrite any files from past 
assignments.
Once you've got the files in the right locations,
you should re-run the shared building scripts from the top level folder,
using <code>premake4 gmake; make</code>.  That should cause the necessary
Lua libraries and header files to be installed.
</p>
<p>
In the <code>A3/</code> folder, you'll find what should be a familiar
layout of files by this point in the course.  You shouldn't need to make any
changes to the startup code (<code>main.cpp</code>) or the Lua glue
code (<code>lua488.hpp</code>, <code>scene_lua.hpp</code>, and
<code>scene_lua.cpp</code>), but you're likely to end up touching the
other source files.  Of course, you may wish to change other files if
you extend the basic application.  That's fine, as long as the program
works as expected on our sample input.  If you're unsure whether a
change is acceptable, feel free to ask on Piazza or by email.
</p>
<p>
The <code>A3</code> executable requires a command-line argument as input,
specifying the filename of a puppet Lua file.  The <code>Assets/</code>
directory includes several sample files, including <code>a3mark.lua</code>,
which we'll use as part of marking.
</p>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>

<p>
Prepare and upload a ZIP file of the <code>A3/</code> directory, omitting
unnecessary files (executables, build files, etc.).  Make sure to include
a <code>puppet.lua</code> file the <code>A3/</code> directory, which contains
the model you are officially
submitting.  (You can include other Lua files if you want.)
In your directory, include a <code>README</code> file and a screenshot
(one that includes the GUI panel).
If you omit either file, you will receive a deduction.   In your
<code>README</code>, please include two additional bits of documentation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Document any changes you make to the data structures used in the
	application.</li>
<li>Give a high-level overview of the hierarchical model of your puppet,
	possibly including a diagram showing how the components are related
	to each other..</li>
</ul>
