	<h3>Summary</h3>

	<p>
	Your goal of this assignment is to write a program to draw a wireframe
	cube.  You can apply modelling transformations to the cube, and viewing
	transformations to the camera.  That might sound easy, especially 
	in light of all the cubes in Assignment 1, but there's a catch: 
	all you're allowed to do is draw lines directly in normalized 
	device coordinates.
	You will be responsible for implementing the geometric pipeline, 
	including perspective projection and clipping.  This assignment provides
	a good way to see all the parts of the pipeline in a single place.
	</p>
	<p>
	You should construct your cube using the eight vertices 
	(±1, ±1, ±1).  You must also draw two coordinate
	frames (sometimes called <em>gnomons</em> in this context).  The first
	will represent the cube's local <b>modelling coordinates</b>; its
	origin is the cube's centre, and it will
	be subjected to every modelling, viewing and projection transformation
	applied to the cube, <em>except</em> for scaling.  The second will 
	represent <b>world coordinates</b>.  These will be the same size as the
	modelling axes, but they will remain fixed at (0,0,0)—they 
	will be subjected only to the viewing and projection transformations.
	Draw each gnomon so that its <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em>
	axes are visually distinct; the most obvious means of doing so is
	to draw them with different colours.
	(Though these coordinate frames are conceptually of unit length,
	you'll probably want to scale them when drawing them in order to ensure
	they're visible on screen.)
	</p>
	<p>
	You will apply modelling transformations to the box
	(rotations, translations, and scales) and viewing transformations
	to the eyepoint (rotations and translations). The user interface will
	allow you to select which class of transformation to apply.
	In each mode, dragging with a combination of mouse buttons pressed
	will use the <em>x</em> position of the mouse to control the axes
	on which a transformation will act.
	</p>
	<p>
	You will need to maintain four distinct coordinate systems
	in this assignment. Three of these coordinate systems are
	3D and one is 2D: the box ("model") coordinates (3D), the
	eyepoint ("view") coordinates (3D), the universal ("world")
	coordinates (3D), and the display ("screen") 2D normalized
	device coordinates (which arise from the perspective
	projection of the eye's view onto the eye's <em>xy</em> plane).
	</p>
	<p>
	The modelling transformations apply with respect to 
	model coordinates (i.e., a model mode rotation about the
	<em>x</em> axis will rotate the box about its current <em>x</em> axis,
	not the world's <em>x</em> axis).  The viewing transformations apply
	with respect to view coordinates (i.e., a view mode
	rotation about the <em>x</em> axis will appear to swing the objects
	in view up or down on the screen, since the eye's <em>x</em> axis
	appears parallel to the screen's horizontal axis). None of
	the modelling transformations will change world coordinates
	(i.e., the world gnomon never changes its location, though,
	of course, it may drift out of our view as a result of
	viewing transformations).
	</p>
	<p>
	You are to form all matrices yourself and accumulate all
	matrix products in software. You will also do the perspective
	projection yourself, including the division to convert from
	3D homogeneous coordinates to 2D Cartesian coordinates.
	This means that you will have to do a 3D near-plane line/plane
	clip in the viewing coordinate system to avoid dividing by
	zero or having line segments "wrap around".
	</p>

	<h3>The interface</h3>

	<p>
	Your GUI panel must contain at least the following widgets:
	</p>

	<ul>
	<li>A <b>Reset</b> button (keyboard shortcut <b>A</b>), which 
	restores the original state of all transforms and perspective 
	parameters, and sets the viewport to its initial state.</li>

	<li>A <b>Quit</b> button (keyboard shortcut <b>Q</b>), which
	terminates the program.</li>

	<li>A set of radio buttons that control the current interaction modes.
	The interaction modes are listed in detail below.</li>

	<li>A status line indicating (at least) the locations of the near
	and far planes (i.e., their distances from the camera).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	The main means of interaction with the environment is by
	dragging the mouse with one or more buttons held down.  When
	a mouse button is pressed, relative horizontal motion of the cursor
	is tracked and the transformations are continuously updated
	until a button up event is received.  If multiple mouse
	buttons are held down simultaneously, all relevant parameters
	should be updated in parallel. This can be a bit tricky when rotating
	with multiple mouse buttons simultaneously, since rotations around
	the different axes don't commute.  In this case, 
	you may apply the rotations in a fixed order of your choosing.
	In general, you will want to be able to compose an <em>arbitrary</em>
	sequence of transformations.
	</p>

	<p>Here are the interaction modes you must support:</p>

	<ul>
	<li><b>Rotate View</b> (keyboard shortcut <b>O</b>): 
	<ul><li>Dragging with the left mouse button rotates the view
		vector about the eye's <em>x</em> (horizontal) axis.</li>
		<li>Dragging with the middle mouse button rotates the view
		about the eye's <em>y</em> (vertical) axis.</li>
		<li>Dragging with the right mouse button rotates the view
		about the eye's <em>z</em> axis.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li><b>Translate View</b> (keyboard shortcut <b>N</b>): 
	<ul><li>Dragging with the left mouse button translates the eye 
		position along the eye's <em>x</em> (horizontal) axis.</li>
		<li>Dragging with the middle mouse button translates the eye 
		position along the eye's <em>y</em> axis.</li>
		<li>Dragging with the right mouse button translates the eye 
		position along the eye's <em>z</em> axis.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li><b>Perspective</b> (keyboard shortcut <b>P</b>): 
	<ul><li>Dragging with the left mouse button changes the field
		of view (FOV) of the projection over a range from 5 to 160 degrees.
		</li>
		<li>Dragging with the middle mouse button translates projection's
			near plane along the view direction.</li>
		<li>Dragging with the right mouse button translates projection's
			far plane along the view direction.</li>
		</ul>
		(A good default value for FOV is 30 degrees.)
	</li>

	<li><b>Rotate Model</b> (keyboard shortcut <b>R</b>): 
	<ul><li>Dragging with the left mouse button rotates the cube
		about its local <em>x</em> axis.</li>
		<li>Dragging with the middle mouse button rotates the cube
		about its local <em>y</em> axis.</li>
		<li>Dragging with the right mouse button rotates the cube
		about its local <em>z</em> axis.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li><b>Translate Model</b> (keyboard shortcut <b>T</b>): 
	<ul><li>Dragging with the left mouse button translates the cube
		about its local <em>x</em> axis.</li>
		<li>Dragging with the middle mouse button translates the cube
		about its local <em>y</em> axis.</li>
		<li>Dragging with the right mouse button translates the cube
		about its local <em>z</em> axis.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li><b>Scale Model</b> (keyboard shortcut <b>S</b>): 
	<ul><li>Dragging with the left mouse button scales the cube
		in its local <em>x</em> direction.</li>
		<li>Dragging with the middle mouse button scales the cube
		in its local <em>y</em> direction.</li>
		<li>Dragging with the right mouse button scales the cube
		in its local <em>z</em> direction.</li>
		</ul>
		(Note that scaling the cube non-uniformly might mean that
		it no longer looks like a cube when drawn, but like a more
		general box.)
	</li>

	<li><b>Viewport</b> (keyboard shortcut <b>V</b>): use the mouse	
		to draw an axis-aligned rectangle on screen, which defines
		the viewport in normalized device coordinates into which the scene
		will be drawn. More information about Viewport mode below.
	</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	The initial interaction mode should be "Rotate Model", and this mode
	should be restored on a reset.  The amount of translation, rotation,
	or scaling will be determined from the relative change in the cursor's
	<em>x</em> value referenced to the value read at the time the mouse 
	button was last moved.  Make sure your program doesn’t get confused if 
	more than one button is pressed at the same time; all the motion events
	should be processed simultaneously, as specified above, although
	individual “incremental” transformations can be composed in a fixed order
	(for example, when rotating around multiple axes simultaneously, you can
	decide on a fixed order in which the axis rotations will be applied).
	</p>
	<p>
	You should use appropriate scaling factors to map the relative mouse
	motion to reasonable changes in the model and viewing transformations.
	For example, you might map the width of the application window to a
	rotation of
	180 or 360 degrees.  On the other hand, do not limit the total 
	accumulation of rotations and translations; i.e., there should be no
	restriction on the cumulative amount of rotation or translation applied 
	to an object, or to the number of sequential transformations.
	</p>

	<h3>Viewport mode</h3>

<p>
Viewport mode allows the user to change the viewport. Assume
that you have a square window into the world, and that this window
is mapped to the (possibly non-square) viewport.  The window-to-viewport
mapping should be as described in the lecture notes and the course
text: if the aspect ratio of the viewport doesn’t match the aspect
ratio of the window (i.e., the viewport is not square), then the
objects appearing in the viewport will be stretched. Further, when
you change the viewport, you will see the same objects in the new
viewport (possibly scaled and stretched) that you saw in the old
viewport.
</p>
<p>
You must draw the outline of the viewport so that we can tell
where it is.
</p>
<p>
In Viewport mode, the left mouse button is used to draw a new
viewport. Pressing the left mouse button sets one corner.  
While the mouse is moving with the button held down, you should 
dynamically update the viewport, and when the button is released,
that viewport should remain in effect.  You should
be able to draw a viewport by specifying the corners in any order.
If the mouse position is outside the window when dragging or releasing
the button, clamp the edges of
the viewport to the visible part of the window.
</p>
<p>
The initial viewport should fill 90% of the full window size, with
a 5% margin around the top, bottom, left and right edges. This is
important so that we can verify that your viewport clipping works
correctly—if you do not do this, you may lose marks in two places.
The user should be able to set the viewport to any portion of the
application window, including sizes larger than the original size. Note
also that the viewport is to be reset to the initial size when the reset
option is selected from the file menu
</p>

<h3>Projection</h3>

<p>
You must implement a perspective projection. This will
make the cube look three dimensional, with perspective foreshortening
distinguishing front and back. You may use a projective transformation
matrix, if you wish.  However, note that for this assignment there
is no need to transform the <em>z</em>-coordinate. Thus you could use 
the mappings <em>x→x/z</em> and <em>y→y/z</em> directly,
although note that some additional scaling will be
necessary to account for the field of view.  If you do wish to 
construct a perspective projection matrix, you must do so
<em>manually</em>—you may not simply use a library function that
creates perspective matrices.  (That is, you may use a type like 
<code>mat4</code> to hold the perspective matrix, but you must construct
the matrix with explicit values.)
</p>
<p>
If you cannot get perspective projection working,
you may implement an orthographic view (no perspective) instead.
You will not get a mark for Objective 7, but you may still complete most
of the other objectives in the assignment. It may actually be useful
to implement an orthographic view first in order to get model and
view transformations working, and return to add perspective projection last.
</p>

<h3>Clipping</h3>

<p>
You will need to clip your lines to the viewing volume. There are
several ways to clip, any of which will suffice for this assignment.
Note, however, that you <em>must</em> clip to the near plane before 
performing perspective projection, or you will get odd behaviour and
crashes. You may find it easiest to clip to the remaining sides
of the viewing volume after projection (since you
will be clipping to a cube), but you may clip at any point in your
program. Note that we will be testing clipping against all sides
of the view volume.
</p>

<h3>Donated code</h3>

<p>
You should download the <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs488/Fall2015/cs488-a2.zip">A2 skeleton code</a>
and unzip it directly into your <code>cs488</code> directory along
with A0 and A1. You will make changes to <code>A2.hpp</code> and
<code>A2.cpp</code>.  This assignment is somewhat unusual, because
you will not use any OpenGL API calls directly; instead, you must
rely on the provided methods for drawing coloured lines.  With that
in mind, you should focus on the following additions/changes to the
code:
</p>
<ul>
<li>In <code>A2.hpp</code>, add whatever member fields you want to 
	track the current state of the modelling, viewing and projection
	transformations, as well as the viewport.</li>
<li>In <code>A2::appLogic()</code>, remove the sample code that
	draws a few simple lines, and replace it with your code for
	drawing the cube, gnomons, and viewport. Use the provided
	methods <code>initLineData()</code>, <code>drawLine()</code>,
	and <code>setLineColour()</code>.</li>
<li>In <code>A2::guiLogic()</code>, add code to draw the UI widgets
	listed above.</li>
<li>Add interaction callbacks to track the mouse and perform transformations
	appropriate for the current interaction mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Again, the code you add should <em>contain no OpenGL calls</em>—all
drawing is hidden behind <code>drawLine()</code>.  In addition, while
you are permitted to use most of the vector and matrix manipulation
code in the GLM library, please <em>do not</em> use the function
<code>glm::perspective()</code>.  If you use a matrix to implement
perspective projection, <em>you must construct that matrix explicitly 
yourself</em> (you can still use a <code>mat4</code> to hold it, though).
If you're unsure about what functions you are or are not allowed to use,
or where you can add code, please ask on Piazza.
</p>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>

<p>
As always, prepare a ZIP file of the <code>A2/</code> directory, omitting
unnecessary files (executables, build files, etc.). Upload the ZIP file to 
LEARN.  In that directory, include a <code>README</code> file and a screenshot.
If you omit either file, you will receive a deduction. 
</p>

<h3>Objective list</h3>

	<p>
	Every assignment includes a list of objectives.  Your mark in the
	assignment will be based primarily on the achievement of these objectives,
	with possible deductions outside the list if necessary.
