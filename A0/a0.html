	<h3>Summary</h3>

	<p>
	The goal of this assignment is to get you accustomed to the
	websites, tools and technology that we will use throughout
	the term.  There will be a small amount of coding, but you will
	not need to write any OpenGL code yourself—those parts of
	the assignment will be provided for you.
	</p>
	<p>
	This assignment is <em>optional</em>.  If you do not hand it in, you
	will not lose marks. If you do hand it in, it will be marked
	in the normal way, but the mark will not count towards your final
	grade.  The problem is that it's all too easy to lose marks on 
	future assignments for silly reasons that have nothing to do with
	understanding the material (such as misunderstanding the submission
	instructions, or failing to include appropriate documentation).
	Completing Assignment 0 will help you avoid making any such mistakes
	when it counts.  You'll also get some direct experience with the
	kind of code you'll be writing throughout the term.
	</p>
	<p>
	This term we're changing the libraries we're using, as well as the
	build process.  It's possible (indeed, likely) that we've introduced
	problems that will affect your ability to complete future assignments.
	So there's another important reason for you to complete Assignment 0:
	your feedback will help us iron out these problems, so that future
	assignments will go more smoothly for <em>all</em> of us.
	</p>
	<p>
	The directions in this assignment are more
	explicit than in the remaining assignments.  In the future,
	the steps to follow will not be written as explicitly.
	</p>

	<h3>Step 1: Piazza</h3>

	<p>
	In order to ask questions, help your fellow students, and keep up
	with timely announcements, you will need to enrol in the Piazza
	site for this course.  Please use the 
	<a href="http://piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/fall2015/cs488">sign up</a>
	link to enrol.  You are not required to use your uwaterloo.ca address,
	but we'll want to know who you are.  <b>On LEARN, submit a text file
	called <code>piazza.txt</code> that contains the email address you
	used to enrol online, whether or not it was a uwaterloo.ca address.</b>
	</p>

	<h3>Step 2: Framework and source code</h3>

	<p>
	By itself, OpenGL doesn't make it possible to write complete programs.
	At the very least, it needs a way to talk to the computer's window
	system.  And of course, there are numerous libraries, toolkits, 
	and frameworks that we can layer on top of OpenGL to make coding
	easier.  For this course we seek a middle ground: enough infrastructure
	to help you get started, without hiding the technical details of
	OpenGL programming.  We're using the following:
	</p>

	<ul>
	<li>C++</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/skaslev/gl3w">gl3w</a>, a low-level
		system that provides access to the official OpenGL API.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.glfw.org/">GLFW</a>, a simple framework
		that wraps an OpenGL context inside a window and manages
		user events.</li>
	<li><a href="http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.7/index.html">GLM</a>,
		a mathematical library for the parts of linear algebra needed
		in computer graphics.  Conveniently, it mimics the types
		and features of 
		<a href="https://www.opengl.org/documentation/glsl/">GLSL</a>,
		the shader programming language used with OpenGL.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">ImGui</a>, a
		user interface toolkit.</li>
	<li>cs488-framework, a thin layer on top of the libraries listed
		above.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	To avoid potential problems with missing libraries or incorrect 
	versions, you will download a package from us that contains the
	source code for all these libraries, bundled in with skeleton
	code for Assignments 0 and 1.
	</p>
	<p>
	To begin, download the file <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs488/Fall2015/cs488-a0a1.zip">cs488-a0a1.zip</a>
	and unzip it.  The bundled libraries are all in <code>shared/</code>.
	You don't need to change anything in that directory.  The assignments
	can be completed by writing code in the <code>A0/</code>,
	<code>A1/</code>...  directories.
	</p>
	<p>Now build the bundled libraries.  They have different build processes,
	but we've provided a quick way to get it all done at once:
	</p>
	<pre>  $ cd cs488
  cs488$ premake4 gmake
  cs488$ make</pre>
	<p>(You'll need to have <code>premake4</code> and <code>cmake</code>
	installed on your system.)</p>

	<h3>Step 3: My First Triangle</h3>
	
	<p>
	Now go into the <code>A0/</code> directory and build the skeleton
	code:
	</p>
<pre>  $ cd A0
  cs488$ premake4 gmake
  cs488$ make</pre>

   <p>You'll see a window with a single white triangle and a small 
   	  palette in the corner with user interface controls.</p>

	<center>
		<img style="max-width : 75%" src="./CS 488_688_ Introduction to Computer Graphics_files/a0_initial.png">
	</center>

	<br>
	<p>
	Now make the following changes to the program, all in <code>A0.cpp</code>:
	</p>

	<ol>
	<li>Initially, the Quit Application button is placed underneath
		the Red Channel slider.  Move it so that it's the first control
		in the Shape Properties palette.  Also, add a keyboard shortcut:
		the <b>Q</b> key should quit the program.
	</li>
	<li>Add two new sliders to Shape Properties: a Green Channel and a 
		Blue Channel.  Taken together, the three sliders should
		give you complete control over the RGB colour of the triangle.
	</li>
	<li>Add a slider to control the rotation angle of the triangle
		(there's already a rotation member variable in the <code>A0</code> 
		class that you can set).  The slider should allow you to rotate the
		triangle through exactly one complete circle.
	</li>
	<li>Add keyboard shortcuts to scale the triangle (again, use the
		defined member variable).  Use the <b>-</b> 
		(minus) key to scale down by a constant factor, and the <b>+</b>
		(plus) key to scale up by the same factor.  Choose your factor
		so that the triangle scales at a reasonable rate.
	</li>
	<li>Between the Quit button and the sliders, add a Reset button
		that sets the triangle back into its original state (colour,
		scale, rotation, position).  Add a keyboard shortcut, so that
		the <b>R</b> key resets.
	</li>
	<li>Take a screenshot of your finished program and store it as
		<code>A0/screenshot.png</code>.
	</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Step 4: README</h3>

	<p>
	For programming assignments, you will be required to create a
	text file called <code>README</code>.  Place your <code>README</code>
	file in the <code>A0/</code> directory.  The <code>README</code> 
	file should contain two sections:
	</p>

	<ul>
	<li><b>Compilation:</b> Give short instructions on how to compile 
		and run the program.  Indicate if there are any changes relative
		to the default premake4/make combination.  Mention any additional
		assumptions (for example, if the program must be run from a particular
		directory).  Also tell us on which lab computer you completed the
		assignment (if we can't get your program running, we'll try it
		on the computer you used as a failsafe).
	</li>
	<li><p><b>Manual:</b> The manual is not a restatement of the assignment
		specification: we know what the program is supposed to do.  The
		manual should include any details or assumptions that you have
		made that were not included in the specification. Tell us about
		any extra commands, options or features you added, or any additional
		data files that you may have generated. If you have made any
		assumptions about the assignment specification or the objectives, 
		be sure you state and justify them here.</p>
		<p>
		You should also note in your manual any
		objectives that you did not complete. If you wrote
		code for objectives that you did not get completed,
		you may request <b>code credit</b> in your manual.
		See Section 3.9 of the <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs488/cn.pdf">course outline</a>
		for information about code credit.
		</p>
	</li></ul>

	<h3>Step 5: Submitting your program</h3>
	
	<p>
	In most assignments, you'll need to upload a directory of code.  Create 
	a ZIP file containing the <code>A0/</code> directory and all its
	contents.  Upload it to LEARN.  If you want to be helpful, do a
	<code>make clean</code> in <code>A0/</code> before zipping it up,
	to avoid including unneeded build files.
	</p>
	<p>
	You are not required to work on the lab machines to complete assignments,
	but <em>your code must compile and run cleanly on the lab machines</em>.
	It is your responsibility to ensure that this is the case!  Please
	try your code at least once on a lab machine before submitting it.
	You will lose marks if we cannot compile and run it right out of the
	box.
	</p>

	<h3>Step 5: Objective list</h3>

	<p>
	Every assignment includes a list of objectives.  Your mark in the
	assignment will be based primarily on the achievement of these objectives,
	with possible deductions outside the list if necessary.
	</p>

	<div class="panel panel-default">
	  <div class="panel-heading">
		<h3 class="panel-title">Assignment 0 objectives</h3>
