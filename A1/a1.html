	<h3>Summary</h3>

	<p>
	In this assignment you will learn the basics of programming real-time
	3D graphics using OpenGL. You will create geometric primitives, draw
	them to the screen, and modify the contents of the 3D environment
	in response to user interaction.
	</p>
	<p>
	In particular, you will develop a 3D sandbox environment for 
	constructing coloured, low-resolution blocky landscapes from cubes.
	The program is inspired by the 3D sandbox game 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft">Minecraft</a>,
	though it's a pretty improverished version of that game, since you
	can only build upward in columns.  (Also, there is no texturing,
	no shading, no redstone, no creepers, no cats, etc.)  Let's call
	it Barcraft.
	</p>

	<h3>The Barcraft environment</h3>

	<p>
	The most obvious feature of the Barcraft environment is the grid,
	which lies on the ground (i.e., the plane <var>y</var> = 0) and
	defines the legal squares upon which individual bars may be 
	grown.  Each grid cell is a unit square, and the grid itself is
	an <var>N</var>×<var>N</var> arrangement of legal cells
	for some constant <var>N</var>.
	In the environment, we actually draw a grid of size 
	(<var>N</var>+2)×(<var>N</var>+2), surrounding the main
	grid with an extra ring of cells as a visual reference.  This
	extra ring is purely for decoration—no bars can be grown on 
	it.
	</p>
	<p>
	Every live (non-ring) grid cell supports a <em>bar</em>.  The bar is a
	stack of unit cubes, all of the same colour.  The point of the Barcraft
	environment is to navigate around on the grid, growing and shrinking
	the bars and assigning colours to them, in order to produce a simple
	landscape, sculpture, or heightfield.
	</p>
	<p>
	At any time, one cell in the grid is "active".  Commands to grow
	or shrink bars should affect that cell.  The active cell is clearly
	indicated in the user interface in some way, for example, by highlighting
	the cell or the top of the bar that lives on it.  Whatever form of
	indication is used, it should be drawn <em>on top</em> of the rest
	of the Barcraft environment; otherwise it may be hidden by tall bars
	in other cells that cover up the active cell.  (It may also be possible
	to include useful indicators in the outer ring of cells.)
	</p><p>
	For the most part, we will
	use the keyboard to control the modelling environment, as explained
	below.  In addition, we can manipulate the view in a 
	few simple ways via the mouse: we can rotate the grid around its
	centre to look at the design from all angles, and scale it up or
	down.
	</p>

	<h3>User interaction</h3>

	<p>
	Your implementation of Barcraft should support (at least) the following
	commands and interactions:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Quit Application:</b> There should be a Quit Application button
		in the control panel that terminates.  It should also be possible
		to perform this action using the <b>Q</b> key.</li>
	<li><b>Reset:</b> There should be a Reset button that restores the
		grid to its initial, empty state, resets the view to the default,
		and moves the active cell back to (0,0).  (Hotkey: <b>R</b>)</li>
	<li><b>Colours:</b> There should be at least eight colours that can 
		be applied to bars.  The colours should be defined via a sequence
		of colour pickers in the control panel, each paired with a radio
		button.  Clicking the radio button sets the active colour, so that
		any new bars (i.e., those grown on initially empty cells) are
		given that colour.  If there is already a bar in the active cell,
		the selected colour is also applied immediately to that bar.
		Editing the colour itself (e.g., changing the R, G and B sliders) 
		should immediately affect <em>all</em> bars of that colour in the 
		grid.</li>
	<li><b>Rotation:</b> Dragging the mouse to the left or the right 
		should rotate the grid smoothly around its centre (as if it were 
		sitting
		on a turntable).  This feature lets the user examine the grid from
		all angles.  Moving the mouse should produce a "reasonable"
		amount of rotation, proportional to the distance travelled by
		the mouse in the <var>x</var> direction.</li>
	<li><b>Scaling:</b> The mouse's scroll wheel (or the scroll gesture
		on a trackpad) should control the scaling of the grid.  Scrolling
		down should make the grid smaller, scrolling up should make it
		bigger.  The amount of scaling should be constrained by reasonably
		chosen maximum and minimum amounts.</li>
	<li><b>Growing bars:</b> The <b>space</b> key should grow the bar in the
		active cell by one unit.  The <b>backspace</b> key should shrink it
		by one unit.  It should not be possible to shrink a bar below
		the ground plane.  The environment may impose an upper limit
		on bar height, but this limit is not required.</li>
	<li><b>Arrow keys:</b> The arrow keys move the active cell around
		on the grid. Use the <b>left</b> and <b>right</b>
		arrows to modify the <var>x</var>
		location of the active cell, and the 
		<b>up</b> and <b>down</b> arrows to modify
		<var>y</var>.  Holding down the <b>shift</b> key with the arrows adds
		extra functionality: when the active cell moves, it <em>copies</em>
		the height and colour of the bar from its previous location.
		Thus, by holding the <b>shift</b> key and walking around with the 
		arrows,
		it's easy to build a wall of a given height and colour.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Skeleton code</h3>

	<p>
	If you haven't already, follow the instructions in 
	<a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs488/Fall2015/a0.html">Assignment 0</a> for downloading the framework and
	skeleton code.  You'll find the skeleton code for this
	assignment in the <code>A1/</code> directory.  It should compile
	and run out of the box using the same premake4/make commands used
	for Assignment 0.  You'll see the the skeleton program sets up
	the control panel, including a Quit button and single example of
	a colour slider and radio button.  It also draws a ground grid
	for you.  Notice that the grid is of size 18×18.  The live
	area of the grid is 16×16, as defined by the constant 
	<code>DIM</code> in <code>A1.cpp</code>; the program automatically
	adds the extra ring of cells around the live core.  The program
	defines reasonable initial values for the projection, view and
	model matrices, and passes them into the vertex shader for you.
	</p>
	<p>
	Here is a suggested sequence of steps to get you started with this
	assignment. (But feel free to work on the assignment in any order
	you want!)
	</p>
	<ol>
	<li>First and foremost, get a cube on the screen.  This is probably
 		the hardest part of the assignment!  Define the geometry of a 
		unit cube, and get it into OpenGL by creating appropriate
		attribute arrays and vertex buffers.  You <em>must</em> use
		modern OpenGL commands here and throughout the assignment.
		That is, eventually you'll draw cubes using a function like
		<code>glDrawArrays()</code> or <code>glDrawElements()</code>,
		and you should never call functions like <code>glVertex()</code>.
		</li>
	<li>See if you can draw a stack of cubes instead of just one.</li>
	<li>If you can do that, hook up the <b>space</b> and <b>backspace</b>
		keys to grow and shrink that stack.</li>
	<li>Now define an active cell, and figure out a reasonable way to 
		indicate it in the user interface.  As mentioned above, the
		indicator should always be drawn on top of all other 3D geometry.  
		That's easily done by temporarily disabling depth testing.  Once
		the indicator is drawn, add the code to move it around using the
		arrow keys.  Then make sure that <b>space</b> and <b>backspace</b>
		are applied to the active cell.</li>
	<li>Next, add in the functionality for copying by holding down 
		<b>shift</b> with the arrow keys.</li>
	<li>Turn the single colour selector into at least eight colours.
		Write the code to hook up clicks on radio buttons with changing
		the colour of the bar in the active cell and setting the colour
		for any new bars.  Make sure that editing the colours modifies
		all bars of that colour in the world.</li>
	<li>Add in mouse rotation.  This is most easily accomplished by 
		modifying the model-to-world transformation while holding the
		camera fixed.  As is typical in interactive programs, it'll
		help to keep track of the <em>previous</em> <var>x</var>
		position of the mouse, so that you can rotate by an amount
		proportional to the <em>difference</em> in <var>x</var>
		every time you receive a mouse event.  (Note that after rotating,
		the arrow keys might become quite unintuitive, since the grid
		is rotated relative to the directions of the keys.  You don't
		have to worry about that for this assignment.)
		</li>
	<li>Add scaling by responding to scroll events.  There are probably
		several ways to do this.  One would be to scale the world itself
		by manipulating the model-to-world transformation.  Another is
		to move the camera closer to or farther from the centre of the
		grid.  Either technique is fine, as long as the scaling is
		bounded within reasonable limits.</li>
	<li>Finally, add in the Reset button and its hotkey, setting all the 
		values manipulated above back to the defaults.</li>
		
	</ol>

	<h3>Deliverables</h3>
	
	<p>
	The submission process for this assignment is basically the same
	as the one for Assignment 0.  Prepare a ZIP file of the <code>A1/</code>
	directory, omitting unnecessary files (executables, build files, etc.).
	Upload the ZIP file to LEARN.
	</p>
	<p>As with Assignment 0, you <em>must</em> submit two other files 
	in your <code>A1/</code> directory: the <code>README</code> and
	a screenshot.  If you omit either file, you will receive a deduction.
	See <a href="https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs488/Fall2015/a0.html">Assignment 0</a> for instructions about how
	to prepare these two files.
	</p>

	<h3>Other thoughts</h3>

	<p>
	As OpenGL has evolved, the API has actually gotten a bit more streamlined.
	The part of OpenGL you talk to from inside a C++ application tends to
	focus on telling the GPU about the pieces of data that power your
	program, and maybe setting a couple of system-wide parameters; most
	of the actual "graphics" has been pushed into the shaders.
	</p>
	<p>
	If it helps, here is the complete set of OpenGL API calls we used in
	the model solution.  <em>This is for information only:</em> you should
	feel free to use a subset of these functions, and to include others
	not on the list.  But you should <em>not</em> use deprecated OpenGL
	calls from the compatibility profile: no <code>glBegin()</code>, 
	<code>glVertex()</code>, or <code>glEnd()</code>!
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li><code>glBindBuffer()</code></li>
	<li><code>glBindVertexArray()</code></li>
	<li><code>glBufferData()</code></li>
	<li><code>glClearColor()</code></li>
	<li><code>glDisable()</code></li>
	<li><code>glDrawArrays()</code></li>
	<li><code>glDrawElements()</code></li>
	<li><code>glEnable()</code></li>
	<li><code>glEnableVertexAttribArray()</code></li>
	<li><code>glGenBuffers()</code></li>
	<li><code>glGenVertexArrays()</code></li>
	<li><code>glUniform3f()</code></li>
	<li><code>glUniformMatrix4fv()</code></li>
	<li><code>glVertexAttribPointer()</code></li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Ideas for extensions</h4>

	<p>
	The core Barcraft environment is a great starting point for expansion
	in new directions. We'd be excited to see what additional features
	you can pack on top of the base interface, if you've got the time.
	We <em>may</em> award a bonus point or two for especially ambitious
	extensions.  Here are some random ideas for extensions:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>
		The look of Barcraft is pretty bare-bones.  In fact, given
		that bars are flat, solid colours, the 3D geometry of the
		world can be pretty hard to understand.  Try to add some
		kind of simple shading model to your cubes, possibly including
		lights.  The simplest model is Lambertian shading based on
		an implied directional light source (though you'll discover
		that flat shaded meshes are surprisingly annoying to set up
		in modern OpenGL).  If you want to get really fancy, look
		around for Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion algorithms.
	</li>
	<li>
		An obvious way to get closer to the look of Minecraft is
		to apply textures to your cubes.
	</li>
	<li>
		You could consider extending the geometry beyond bars.  The
		ideal would be a fully 3D grid of voxels that can be controlled
		independently, but it can be hard to design an interface for
		turning individual voxels off and on.
	</li>
	<li>
		Of course, Minecraft's world is much larger than 16×16.
		You could try working with a much larger grid, but beyond a
		certain limit you'll undoubtedly need two things: a "sparse"
		data structure that represents the world without storing data
		for every single cell, and a "culling" algorithm that preprocesses
		the grid and only draws the cells that are actually in view.
	</li>
	<li>
		Implement a way to load and save the contents of the grid, 
		and maybe to load a grid from some kind of image.
	</li>
	<li>
		Add a WASD/mouselook interface so that you can walk (or fly)
		into the maze and look around as if it were a city grid.
		For extra fanciness, implement rudimentary collision detection
		so that you can't walk through cubes.
	</li>
	<li>
		Turn the Bars into a platformer game in which a character
		can walk around on the tops of cubes and jump.
	</li>
	<li>
		Add new geometric primitives beyond cubes.  (Creepers? Sheep?)
	</li>
	<li>
		Modify the key event handlers so that they simulate key repeat,
		making it easier to apply a bunch of growth or movement
		events all at once.
	</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	If you do extend the base interface, be sure to document your 
	extensions in your <code>README</code> file.  Keep in mind that
	you must still satisfy the core objectives listed here.  If
	your changes are so radical that your modified program is 
	incompatible with Barcraft, you must include a "compatibility
	mode" that makes the interface behave like the requirements
	here.  (Or consider creating an entirely separate executable.)
	</p>

	<h3>Step 5: Objective list</h3>

	<p>
	Every assignment includes a list of objectives.  Your mark in the
	assignment will be based primarily on the achievement of these objectives,
